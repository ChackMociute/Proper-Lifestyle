## Issues

Far too much technical implementation for what is a simple prototype. This has taken far too much time and effort in an environment not meant for that kind of work.
All of the code started as one module because the anticipation was that it won't be too large when done. This in combination with the previous mistake has lead to an absurdly long file and spaghetti code. On many occassions I should have refactored or simplified the functionality. But as the course has finished and this project would never be touched again I chose to abandon the possibility of rewriting the program and splitting into many smaller modules.
